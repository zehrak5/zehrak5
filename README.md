Using twine I have created a game where you can pick who you want to be in the time of Tudor England. The options are King Henry VIII, Religious monk, a farmer or a royal court member. If you choose King Henry VIII it will take into the story of you deciding what women you will marry to make your wife and the different stories you will have with them depending on who you pick. If you pick a religious monk it will tell you what and how the monks did and lived in that time. If you pick a royal court member you are able to choose from musician, chancellor, or a lorde and depending on who you pick your life will be according to that and how they lived in those times and what they did. Lastly if you chose to be a farmer you can pick what you will do first if you want to feed the horses, collect the eggs from the chicken, or tend to the pigs. I have used different pictures and colors to bring the game to life and make it more fun.
